One player tries to guess a word based on clues offered by his or her partner. The game is timed, and if the clue-giver inadvertently says part of the word, a buzzer sounds and that round is lost.

    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <title>Tom Rowland Podcast</title>
    <desc>An old friend of mine, Pete Erickson, joins the podcast today. Pete and I met back when we were both fly fishing guides and even room mates in Jackson Hole.  Pete has gone on to do some amazing things in the fly fishing industry. From winning the ESPN Outdoor Games two years after I did, to joining Fly Fishing Team USA, to designing fly rods, Pete has done it all. In this episode we reminisce on some old memories from Jackson Hole.  We try to figure out what the magic recipe from that time and place to launch the careers of Pete, myself who both won the Great Outdoor Games, Carter Andrews, Lori Anne Murphy, Matson Rogers, Tom Montgomery, Paul Bruun, Jeff Currier, Jack Dennis, and so many others.  We discuss euro nymphing techniques, and more. Be sure to check Pete out on Instagram, @pete_erickson_flyfishing
