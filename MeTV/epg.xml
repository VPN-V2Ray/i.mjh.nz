    <desc>"Set in ancient Egypt, the Stooges run a used chariot lot where they unload defective chariots on unsuspecting customers.  When they gyp the head of the palace guard, they're brought to the palace to be executed, but instead become royal chamberlains after curing the King's toothache.  When they recover some tax money stolen by a corrupt official, the King rewards them with marriage to his daughter.  After getting a look at the ugly crone, Moe and Larry select Shemp to be the groom.
, The Stooges are private detectives looking for a missing millionaire.  They wander around the millionaire's spooky mansion confronting various crooks and a dangerous dame.  The Stooges vanquish the crooks (Shemp uses his "trusty shovel") and find the missing man.
, The Stooges are willed a lot of dough from a rich uncle, but the executor of the estate, Icabob Slipp, is a crook who absconds with the money.  The Stooges trail him to a theater where they engage in a wild chase and ultimately recover their inheritance.  [ the opening scenes are taken from "Hold that Lion".  ]
, A divine comedy classic! Shemp goes to Heaven but isn't allowed through the Pearly Gates until he can reform bad boys Larry and Moe. 
, Larry and Shemp are living in a stolen railroad car.  Larry wants to marry his girlfriend, but she won't consent until Shemp marries her sister.  Shemp however, is constantly drunk and in love with "Carry", an imaginary giant canary.  Moe is an investigator from the railroad, sent to discover how the car was stolen from a moving train.  Moe is also in love with Shemp's girl.  Shemp winds up with both women, but still prefers his imaginary canary.
, The Stooges are entrusted with taking care of their friend's house while he goes off to get married.  At first they only wreck the place a little bit, but when they try to install a television antenna, total destruction ensues.  When their friend returns with his bride, she's so shocked she walks out on him.
